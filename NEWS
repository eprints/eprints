eprints-2.1                                                    2002-???
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release contains a major new feature - subscriptions. It also has
OAI-PMH v2.0 support and a few new configuration options.

*       Various bug-fixes, typo-fixes and clarification of text.

*       Added subscriptions - which allows a user to configure searches to
        be run periodically and any new results mailed to them.

*       Now OAI 2 compliant. Note OAI-PMH v2 base URL is different to OAI
        v1 URL - /perl/oai2 - /perl/oai will continue to work.

*       New options in SystemSettings.pm 

        - disable_df which is set disables all the places eprints uses "df". 
          (It is buggy on some platforms).

        - virtualhost which is the value to use in the apache config files
          in VirtualHost entries. By default "*" is used, but some people need
          to change it.

*       Added "POD" documentation to about half of the main perl modules. The
        other modules have stubs describing the methods, but no actual 
        documentation. Use "perldoc Foo.pm" to view docs of a file.

*       Added a new type of metafield - "search". Which is a serialised 
        search expression. 

*       You can now use XHTML entites in the phrase files, static pages
        and the page template eg. &nbsp; &pound; &eacute; etc. These are
        not available in the citations config file.

*       New built-in "custom" field render method: 
        EPrints::Utils::render_xhtml_field which can be set as a 
        render_single_value option in a metafield, it will pass through
        all XHTML elements rather than &lt;foo&gt; escaping them which the
        normal renderer does.

*       New optional configuration options:

        - "pagehooks" to allow extra "stuff" to be added in the <body> and 
          <head> parts and attributes to the <body> tag. This allows people 
          to do clever stuff, like add javascript to some pages.

        - "submission_stages" which allows the admin to change the order
          of the submission form.

*       New metafield attributes: 

        - export_as_xml: This defaults to 1 but if explicitly set to zero it 
          will supress this field in output from export_xml.

        - make_value_orderkey: this is a reference to a function which will
          generate a value to compare alphabetically to order this field.

        - make_single_value_orderkey: as above but only gets passed individual
          values even if the field is multiple.

*       New script - upgrade. This updates the SQL database of an archive to
        work with the latest version of eprints.

*       generate_views should now correctly sort values in the index paeg.

*       Order by subjects, sets or datatypes should now be alphabetical.
       



eprints-2.0.1                                                  2002-04-16
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mostly a bugfix release. Does not change any functionality. (except the 
staff EPrint search)

*       Fixed lots of typos and minor bugs.

*       Changed the default subjects config file to Library of Congress

*       Staff EPrint search can now search all buffers: archive, inbox, 
        buffer and deletion.

*       edit_eprint can now edit eprints in any buffer, and move eprints 
        between buffer, and clone any eprint into the submission buffer.

*       view_submission & edit_submission are now deprecated. All their 
        functions have been taken over by edit_eprint.

*       Added a oai2 script which is experimental and more-or-less speaks
        OAI-PMH v2.0a3


eprints-2.0                                                    2002-02-14

*        Too many changes to mention.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the origional release of eprints 2. It did not actually do 
anything very useful, it just let people see how the project was
progressing.
