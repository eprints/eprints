EPRINTS 3.1.0

See: http://wiki.eprints.org/w/New_Features_in_EPrints_3.1

=========================================================================
EPRINTS 3.0-RC-1                                               2006-12-18
=========================================================================

 * Import via CGI
 * More basic types of eprint:
    Artefact, Exhibition, Composition, Performance, Image, Video,
    Audio, Dataset, Experiment, Teaching Resource.
 * Import via PubMed ID.
 * Import via DOI. 
 * When you enter a title the system checks for possible duplicates as
    you type and lists them as a warning.
 * New autocomplete scripts which can use a file or a database table for
    the lookup.
 * Added a multilingual field type for multilingual titles, abstracts 
    etc.
 * Import and Export via XML of multilingual and compound fields now 
    treats compound fields as one field. 
 * Import subjects via XML now works.
 * "epadmin create" now offers to run the required scripts for you, to
     make setup even easier.
 * Fixed bug which left many cache tables lying around.
 * Tool to edit the subject tree
 * Non-required boolean fields now show a third option to allow them to
    be set to unspecified.
 * Plugins may now have an "advertise" flag. If this is false then the
    plugin is not advertised in the user interface but is still 
    available.
 * Plugins may now be disabled by default. This is used if you have 
    several repositories and only want to enable the plugin on one.
 * XML Export now makes the XML nicely indented.
 * The workflow may now conditionally limit the options available for a 
    set. This allows, for example, to make certain options only available
    on some types of EPrint or only to certain users.
 * The workflow may modify the top subject node so that different parts
    of the subject tree are available for different eprints or users.
 * New default fields for projects and funders and organisational 
    divisions.
 * Added more metadata to the <head> of the summary pages, for the 
    benefit of search engines.
