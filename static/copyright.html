</pre>

<p>CogPrints is an author's archive; as such, it has the same relation to
an author's work as the author's home institution does, when that work is
archived on the home server (as all CogPrints authors are strongly
advised to do, in addition to archiving it in CogPrints).</p>

<p>It is accordingly the author who must adopt a policy about copyright. We
can only offer some generic advice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A distinction should be made between the unrefereed preprint and
the refereed, edited, published reprint. No copyright agreement has any
bearing on the unrefereed preprint, which can be publicly archived
online before the refereeing even takes place.</p>

<p>Hence the rest of the points below pertain only to the refereed,
edited, published reprint. Preprints can be archived without reference
to any copyright agreement or publisher.</p>

<p>(Note, however, that a minority of journals have indicated that they
will not referee papers that have been publicly archived online. It is
not clear whether any attempt has been made to enforce such a policy --
or indeed whether it would be possible to enforce it at all -- as so
many authors are archiving their papers publicly on their home servers.
See <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/colloquy/98/copyright/11.htm">http://www.chronicle.com/colloquy/98/copyright/11.htm</a>)</p>

<li><p>If you have not signed a copyright transfer statement that cedes
your right to publicly archive your own paper online for free, it is not
clear that there is any problem, but if you wish to confirm this, you
should inform your publisher that you wish to do so, and request
confirmation that there is no legal obstacle. Some journals (such as all
those published by the American Physical Society) explicitly permit
public online archiving of the final published draft by the author;
others attempt to specifically forbid it in their copyright agreements.</p>

<p>Note that any copyright agreement pertains only to the final, refereed,
edited draft that appeared or will appear in print. It does not and
cannot cover pre-refereeing preprints or indeed any penultimate draft that
preceded the final one. (The nature and size of the requisite
difference between the two is to all intents and purposes arbitrary.)</p>

<li><p>If you have signed a copyright transfer agreement ceding your right
to publicly archive your own paper online for free, you should
contact your publisher indicating that you wish to do so; matters are
evolving rapidly in this area and publishers may well be coming around
to more justifiable and enforceable policies.</p>

<li>You should not sign any more such agreements. They are completely
unjustified, and energetic steps are being taken to put an end to them
as soon as possible. See the current copyright discussions and
proposals in Science, Nature, American Scientist, and Chronicle of
Higher Education, respectively:</p>

<p>a more detailed discussion about the copyright issues involved follows.</p>

<a name="policy"></a>
<pre>
> Can I ask a journal to change their copyright policy?
</pre>

<p>Stefano Ghirlanda of Stockholms Universitet offers the following advice.</p>

<p>If you would like to ask a journal to modify their copyright policy so
that you and possibly others can post your articles on the web, you might
find the following suggestions helpful.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Take the initiative</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Some journals will accept a copyright agreement different from their
standard one if asked to, but will not offer a liberal agreement from the
beginning. We know of several journals that will leave non-commerical
distribution of a paper unrestricted if the author asks for it.</p>

<p>Thus, when you get the copyright-transfer form from a journal, just
send back a different, already signed one with a science-friendly
policy. You can model your requests after the American Physical
Society's (APS) policy, which can be found at:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://aps.org/pub/jrnls/copy_trnsfr.asc">ftp://aps.org/pub/jrnls/copy_trnsfr.asc</a></p>

<p>A possible sample text is:</p>

<pre>
    I hereby transfer to [publisher or journal] all rights to sell or
    lease the text (paper and online) of [paper-title]. I retain only
    the right to distribute it for free for scholarly/scientific or
    educational purposes, in particular, the right to self-archive it
    publicly online on the Web.
</pre>

<p>More precise wording (legally speaking) can be found in the APS policy
above. It should be clear that only non-commerical distribution will be
unrestricted, and that the publisher would retain all commerical rights.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong>In case of a "no"</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If your agreement is declined by the journal, it may prove effective to
express concern that a too restrictive copyright policy may hinder the
free circulation of scientific ideas. Say also that people's
willingness to submit to this or that journal may in the future be
influenced by their copyright policies.</p>

<p>Some journals are owned by scientific associations, but the copyright
is often managed by a commercial publisher. Try to go through the
association first, especially if you are or have been a member.</p>
<dd>

<dt><strong>Rejoice</strong></dt>

<dd><p>You can consider your time well spent even when the publisher fails to
accept your conditions. It is important that the journals know what an
author considers an important precondition for submission.</p></dd>

<pre>
> Any further advice?
</pre>

<p>First I will tell you the correct answers, and then I will describe
the potential complications, and how they are likely to be sorted out.</p>

<pre>
> Will inclusion of a paper in CogPrints count as "publication"
> and hence render the paper no longer publishable in paper journals? 
</pre>

<p>You must specify for/to WHOM it will "count"!</p>

<p>CogPrints is certainly not a journal, and I am certainly not a
publisher. All authors retain the copyright for their papers and will
(I hope), in parallel, go on to submit any unrefereed preprint that
they Archive in CogPrints to a refereed journal, as usual.</p>

<p>Appearing in CogPrints is merely like appearing in a University
Department's Tech Report Series (more and more of which are now
electronically available too). For Preprints, CogPrints is just a
global, collective Tech Report Archive for the Cognitive Sciences
(eventually to be integrated with the Archives of other disciplines,
such as Physics).</p>

<p>After the paper is refereed, revised and accepted by the (paper)
journal, the question arises about what to do with the PREprint then:
(1) Leave it in the archive, (2) withdraw it, or (3) replace it with
the final refereed, accepted REprint?</p>

<p>I assume that authors would overwhelmingly prefer (3), while paper
journal publishers may well prefer it otherwise. Indeed, they may
prefer it otherwise even for the preprint, not just for the published
reprint... I will return to this.</p>

<p>The natural thing to do, and certainly the optimal thing for authors
(if they overcome the restrictions of their paper publishers) when
their article is accepted in this electronic age is to make the
validated, peer-reviewed version as widely available as possible
to everyone for free.</p>

<p>In the paper days we mailed reprints (for free); in the electronic age
the natural thing to do is post Eprints. And there is no longer any
need to go through the tedious reprint-requesting and reprint-sending
phases; the reprint can simply be made universally available on the
Net, both at the Author's Home Institution (as a Departmental
Electronic Reprint Series) and in a centralised Archive such as
CogPrints (I am advocating both).</p>

<pre>
> ...who retains copyright of the material? does inclusion in CogPrints
> imply implicit relinquishing of copyright by the author?
</pre>

<p>The author retains the copyright. Nothing is relinquished, and authors
will be expected to submit their papers to refereed journals in the
usual way.</p>

<p>Where copyright issues WILL come up is on the question of whether
authors should continue assigning full copyright to the publishers of
the refereed journals, thereby in effect authorising the publisher to
restrict access to their papers only to those who pay to see them.</p>

<p>This is a HUGE conflict of interest, and it will be in this arena that
the critical events will occur, not in the question of assigning
copyright to electronic Archives: Unlike publishers, CogPrints has no
financial interest in blocking access to the papers it archives,
whether refereed or not. Indeed, CogPrints has no financial interests
at all! The Archives are relatively cheap to maintain, and as their
enormous potential contribution to learned inquiry is demonstrated,
they will continue to be subsidised, as they are now (by NSF in the US
and JISC in the UK).</p>

<p>I will come back to this when I discuss the APA's (American
Psychological Association's) provisional policy on these issues.</p>

<pre>
> What kinds of papers would be included? whose papers would be
> included?
</pre>

<p>CogPrints is not, and is not intended to be, a refereed journal.
Archiving of unrefereed preprints will be entirely under the author's
control (although we will do some filtering to flush out the crazies).
So anyone can archive anything, in principle.</p>

<p>But the reason I am launching it this way -- first approaching the most
important researchers in the cognitive sciences directly, and archiving
their papers "by hand" for them -- is to make sure that the Archive is
launched in the right direction. If I opened it to everyone
immediately, it would quickly become the kind of Global Graffiti Board
that most of the Net (especially Usenet) still is.</p>

<p>Once the quality of the initial archive has been assured by a critical
mass of invited contributions that can serve as a model for its
continuation, I will open it up for public Archiving.</p>

<p>But don't be too worried about what happens when CogPrints goes
public: We have the precedent already of the Physics Archive, which
has now been public for 6 years and is already the locus classicus for
more than half the research in physics worldwide, and still growing
rapidly. There are as many crazies in Physics as in any other
discipline, but they have a negligible effect on the Archive.</p>

<p>Researchers searching the Cognitive Science Literature will continue to
seek the work of the authors they know and trust; moreover, there will
eventually (sooner, I hope, rather than later) be TWO categories of
papers in CogPrints: unrefereed preprints and, first,
author-authenticated reprints of refereed, accepted papers (in the
first phase it will be the author who "marks" them as such), and not
long after, I hope, there will be journal-authenticated reprints, once
paper publishers realise that cooperation is needed, rather than
out-dated and counterproductive access constraints, when the authors'
interests are at stake.</p>

<p>Now, I promised to return to those questions that concern what existing
journal publishers will do:</p>

<p>Before I start, let me say that again the Physics Archive is the herald
of what will happen in all disciplines sooner or later. I strongly
believe that the outcome that is both inevitable and optimal for
authors is that refereed scientific journals will abandon the trade
model on which they are produced now. The trade model was unavoidable
in the paper era, no matter how badly it served research and
researchers: There was no choice but to treat refereed research reports
in the same way trade books and trade magazine articles were treated:
The publisher charged readers for access to the "product," because that
was the only way to recover the substantial cost of publishing in
paper.</p>

<p>But whereas in trade publishing there is no conflict of interest between
author and publisher -- both wish to receive payment for access to their
product -- in refereed learned journals the author never sought (or
received!) payment for his "product" (the report of his research). He
merely went along, reluctantly, with the only viable economic model
there was (namely, the trade model) if he wished to be published at all.</p>

<p>But what is happening in Physics: The American Physical Society, the
most prestigious publisher of refereed journals in physics, is working
out with the Physics Archives a cooperative arrangement in which
articles in the Archive that have been accepted for publication by an
APS journal will be separately "authenticated" by the APS as an overlay
on the archive. What this means, effectively, is that there will
be the same partitioning of the electronic literature as of the
paper literature, into unauthenticated preprints and peer-reviewed,
authenticated reprints.</p>

<p>The devil is in the details, of course, because although the APS (like
the APA, and the other APS -- the American Psychological Society) are
learned society publishers rather than trade publishers, they must take
steps to assure that they are not ruined!</p>

<p>What I believe these steps will be (and now I am trying to foretell
what the actual path to the inevitable and the optimal will be, so my
steps are a bit shaky) are the following:</p>

<p>The much-reduced cost of publishing ONLY in electronic form (and I
guesstimate that this will be at most 30% of the cost of publishing in
paper, but probably even less than that) will no longer be recovered
from the subscriber (which means the sorely taxed budgets of University
serials collections) but from the author's research grant: WE will pay
for the cost of implementing peer review and editing, which will
proceed exactly as it always has, for, as you know, the authors, the
readers, and the referees are, and always have been: US.</p>

<p>That's what I (and an increasing number of others) think will be the
inevitable and optimal solution. But what do publishers think, now?
I append here, with comments, the APA's provisional policy on this.
Let me note that they are not alone. The New England Journal of
Medicine formulated a similar policy a few years ago.</p>

<p>Let me add, though, that the APA, too, is us. It is up to us whether we
comply with this provisional policy for the time being, for it is
certainly a policy that is against our interests -- and one that could
not be implemented if we chose not to comply.</p>

<p>I am not advocating a course of conflict with the APA. I am an advocate
of quiet, sustained subversion rather than aggressive confrontation
(for which there is no need, as the APS story is demonstrating). I
think, therefore, that the best course of action is simply to ignore
the following three "rules" that the APA has provisionally formulated
(supposedly on our behalf, as we are they -- the editors, referees and
authors -- and they are us):</p>

</pre>

<p>Now WHO is considering them as published, and will not consider them for
print publication? Is it the readers of the APA journals? the authors?
the referees? the editors?</p>

<p>No, for all four communities I have named are still perfectly capable of
distinguishing unrefereed preprints from refereed articles, whether the
distinction occurs in the paper or the electronic medium. The
distinction is medium-independent and we all know exactly what it is.</p>

<p>Now in certain special cases, medical journals may have a real
justification for warning their authors not to circulate unrefereed
preprints, whether in paper or electronic form: Publicising results
that have not yet undergone peer review could be dangerous to public
health.</p>

<p>But that concern is likewise medium-independent. Journals are free to
set policies that are really intended to protect public health. But how
much of the scientific -- or even the biomedical -- literature falls
into that category? Cold fusion, for example, which was an instance
of results that should not have passed peer review (although they did)
was set aright much more quickly and effectively through the open
unrefereed discussion and scrutiny it underwent on the Net!</p>

<p>Never mind: Let us concede that there are special areas in which it is
justified to refuse publication if authors have self-publicised
unrefereed findings that put public health at risk.</p>

<p>But what is at issue here is that vast preponderance of the research
literature that does NOT fall in that category (and this includes the
vast majority of the papers that appear in APA journals).</p>

<p>For that literature, the APA edict against archiving unrefereed
preprints on the Net is unjustifiable and completely at odds with
the psychological research community's interests: Would such a rule
have been accepted if it forbade us to circulate our paper preprints
[the ones we send around "for comments only, not for quotation or
citation"], as we have been doing all along?</p>

<p>If the policy would have been seen as clearly unjustified (and
unenforceable) in the paper medium, then exactly the same is true on
the Net.</p>

<pre>
> * Papers posted on the Internet may be considered in the "public domain"
> and downloaded, incorporated into someone else's work and copyrighted
> by them (i.e., authors can "lose" their own copyrights and their own
> right to print publication).
</pre>

<p>I will not dwell on this statement. It is completely false, and by now I
expect that there are many people in the APA who are embarrassed by it.</p>

<p>Statements like this have been made by the big commercial publishers
like Elsevier, in an effort to intimidate their authors about posting
their preprints on the Net. APA should be ashamed for doing likewise.</p>

<p>What underlies the effectiveness of this completely false statement is a
confusion (in the minds of AUTHORS) between copyright as protection from:</p>

<p>(C1) theft of TEXT, which, for the research community, is simply a
victimless crime! every reprint-requester I send my paper to is not
only "stealing" my text -- by not paying for it -- but I am actually
paying [the offprint and postage costs] to aid and abet him in his
crime! In short, this kind of theft is NOT what the nontrade author
wants copyright protection from;</p>

<p>versus copyright as protection from:</p>

<p>(C2) theft of AUTHORSHIP, in which someone else publishes my work as
his own. This IS something that authors very much want to be protected
from (perhaps worrying more about it than is really necessary, but
let's skip over that), but this is not at all what is at issue in
archiving one's preprints on the Net!</p>

<p>The scare-tactic is to imply that posting on the Net is a threat to C2
(which authors certainly do not want) but in reality it is to prevent
C1, which authors DO want!</p>

<p>Nontrade authors must start to think more clearly about copyright.</p>

<pre>
> * Posting a published paper on the Internet may violate the copyright
> transfer agreement related to the print publication.
</pre>

<p>It may indeed. And hence authors are well-advised not to sign such
copyright transfer agreements. If there is a specific clause in a
copyright agreement that implies that I cannot archive my paper on the
Net, I strike that clause. If there is no such clause, I archive my
articles on the Net just as I used to distribute reprints of my
article.</p>

<p>But this is why I said that the copyright issue is not concerned with
our archiving of our preprints on the Net -- we definitely retain
copyright there -- but with assigning copyright to our publisher!
Many people are now working out limited copyright arrangements with
their publishers.</p>

<pre>
> Many of the legal issues surrounding the Internet, online services, service
> providers, and copyright and privacy in the electronic world are murky,

> changing.
</pre>

<p>They are certainly murky and confused; and some parties are benefiting
from keeping them that way: The nontrade author, who seeks and gets no
royalties for his articles, has nothing to protect in court! He is not
selling his texts, so he does not worry about, but rather applauds, their
"theft"!</p>

<p>Copyright protection of AUTHORSHIP is, if anything, more enforceable on
the Net than in paper. For although, to be sure, it is easier for me to
pick up your text from the Net and pass it off as my own than it is to
do it in paper, duplication of text is also much easier to DETECT in
digital texts. So there's a trade-off: If I want to steal your paper
text and publish it as my own, I have to scan it in with OCR, which is
more labour-intensive than stealing bytes that have already been
digitised, but it is probably also safer for me, because then I can
publish it as my own in some other journal, and it is unlikely to be
detected. Whereas on the Net, where gremlins are already scouring the
entire world of digital texts as search engines 24 hours a day, my
crime is much more likely to be found out.</p>

<p>Besides, this is nonsense anyway: Priority can be established much more
rigorously and universally on the Net than in any other medium -- using
encryption and date-coding.</p>

<p>So the legal issues referred to above concern only the TRADE literature,
where it is the TEXT that one wants to protect from theft; for us,
nontrade authors (or at least when we are wearing our nontrade hats, for
of course sometimes we do trade publishing too!) it is only the
AUTHORSHIP that we wish to protect from theft, and that is not at issue
in any of this.</p>

<pre>
> The APA P&C Board has, therefore, adopted an "interim" policy:

</pre>

<p>This slightly garbled text is reproduced here verbatim. It calls to
mind the sort of mumbling and stammering and coughing with which this
sentence must have been uttered, because of course the editors, being
us, have NOT taken this position, and certainly not on their own
initiative. They have been drawn into it by the kinds of
self-interested smoke-screen I have been trying here to dispel.</p>

<p>But I repeat that I prefer subversion to confrontation and conflict.
I am sufficiently adept in this medium to be able to alert the vast
preponderance of research psychologists, including, of course, those
that are serving their terms as editors and associate editors (and
referees, and authors and readers) of the APA journals. I could tell
them all exactly what I have told you, and it would certainly make the
scales fall from the eyes of many of them -- for very few of us have
really given all this much thought: We are so accustomed to seeing the
refereed journals as the disinterested arbiters of the quality of our
research (as they certainly are) that we forget that there is also a
trade side to learned journal publishing that has only an accidental
relation to the invaluable service the journals perform for us.</p>

<p>So if an author who knows that his job, his salary, his tenure, his
likelihood of receiving research funds, prizes etc. all depend on the
refereed journals, he will be easily persuaded that the "journals" are
being as wise and disinterested when they formulate "interim policies"
like the above one for us as they are in weighing the quality of our
research.</p>

<p>But the source of this interim policy is not, and could not be, US
(contrary to the case of peer review itself, where it IS us). WE are
not saying that we regard preprints archived on the Web as
publications, ineligible for refereeing; WE are not the ones who say
that upon acceptance for PUBLICation, we must not make our findings
public in the most powerful and ubiquitous medium that our species has
ever created!</p>

<p>So you see that if I chose the polemical path, I would not be at a loss
for words that would gird the research community into action.</p>

<p>But I prefer to take the peaceful path that Physics has taken: to just
go ahead and DO it, and then let nature take its course.</p>

<p>Moreover, I hope that although what I've called "the inevitable and the
optimal" solution for the learned research community will necessarily
entail some downsizing by the big learned serials publishers --
especially the commercial ones -- I am still not among the most radical
reformers in this area, who advocate that the peers should simply bolt
from the existing journals and and re-establish their editorial boards,
referees, and authors with new electronic-only publishers who are not
already committed to the trade model that is at the heart of the
profound conflict of interest that separates us from learned serials
publishers at this critical juncture in the history of learned
inquiry.</p>

<p>No doubt. But while there will no doubt be many developments for the
task force to worry about, there is no reason for us to accept
this arbitrary and unjustifiable stricture while the task force sorts
things out! On the contrary, we should move vigorously toward the optimal
and the inevitable, rather than allowing it to be needlessly delayed
by those whose interests are so clearly in conflict with our own.</p>

<p>I recommend this because I really believe that it is our proceeding
quietly but firmly along the path of subversion that will eventually
bring publishers to their senses, and persuade them to restructure
themselves in such a way as to continue to provide a service that is
CONSONANT with our interests, rather than contrary to them. For if an
explicit confrontation is forced, I am afraid the traditional
publishers are bound to be the losers.</p>

<p>I hope this reply -- rather longer than I had expected it to be --
answers the questions you raised. I would be especially interested to
hear YOUR reaction in light of this information? Do you now feel
comfortable archiving your preprints on the Net, or not?</p>

</pre>

<p>Jay,</p>

<p>Actually, I think it will be the opposite: The very best journals will
accept only the very best of articles, because not only will their page
quota be unlimited in the positive direction (they will be able to
accept as many articles as they like), but it will not be unconstrained
in the negative direction either: paper journals need to fill their
full annual page quotas or they lose those pages, which are budgeted and
paid for. So on the Net they will be able to afford to accept more or
less on the basis of quality alone, with no consideration of space.</p>

<p>Do you really think it is space constraints that decide which articles
go into JEP rather than QJEP? It's peer review; the referees do the
evaluation and the editors set the threshold.</p>

<p>The reason the quality/prestige hierarchy among journals with different
levels of refereeing rigor exists is not because the best journals have
page quotas: it is because they have higher refereeing thresholds.
There is no reason that Nature or Science (with their impact factors of
27.1 and 21.9) should lower their standards in the electronic medium;
by the same token, why would we expect BBS (15.7) Psych Review (5.1)
JEP:G (3.5), or QJEP (1.4) to lower theirs? In what sense is devaluing
their quality-currency advantageous for learned journals, whose gold
standard is quality, not quantity? Freed from page constraints and
costs, what incentive is there to accept more than the best? Indeed,
the Net will provide much more sensitive and informative ways of
measuring the impact of authors and journals, which will always be
there as feedback for journals should they inadvertently drop their
guard.</p>

<p>In short, I think that, medium-independently, it is the level of rigor
of peer review rather than space pressures that safeguard the quality
of learned journals.</p>

<p>But for CogPrints, these questions are not even at issue, because
CogPrints is not to be a journal but a preprint and reprint archive...</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

see, it does not rule out public archiving of the unrefereed preprint or
the refereed reprint.</p>

    obtaining APS' permission.  However, it is not necessary to obtain 
    permission from APS [only from the author(s)] to quote excerpts from an 
    article or to reprint figures or tables therefrom, as long as no more than 
    25 figures and/or tables from the totality of APS journals are to be 
    reprinted in a single publication.

    for the author's use for lecture or classroom purposes, provided that the 
    first page of such use or copy prominently displays the bibliographic data 
    and the following copyright notice: ``Copyright 19XX by The American 
    Physical Society.''
(4) The right to post and update the article on e-print servers as long as 
    files prepared and/or formatted by APS or its vendors are not used for that
    purpose, and as long as access to the server does not depend on payment of 
    access, subscription, or membership fees.  Any such posting made or updated
    after acceptance of the article for publication shall include a copyright 
    notice as in (3).
(5) If the article has been prepared by an employee within the scope of his or 
    her employment, the employer shall have the right to make copies of the 
    work for his own internal use.  If the article was prepared under a U.S.  
    Government contract, the government shall have the rights under the 
    copyright to the extent required by the contract.

The author(s) agree that all copies of the whole article or abstract made
under any of the above rights shall include notice of the APS copyright.
