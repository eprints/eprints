<a name="postscript"></a>

<p>The program you need is called Ghostview. It is available for free on the
internet at the following URL:<p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/</a></p>

<p>You also need a program called Ghostscript that is used by Ghostview. This
is available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/index.html">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/index.html</a></p>

<p>Details of all this are at the Ghostview site. They're a bit tricky to
install but instructions come with the packages. There's also a Macintosh version of Ghostscript available at:</p>

<a name="convert"></a>
<pre>
> I'm having trouble converting my Microsoft Word (etc.) document
> to HTML.
</pre>

<p>Many word processors, including the lastest version of Microsoft Word, offer a "Save as HTML..." or similar option from the File menu. For other versions of Word, and other word processing packages, two utilities are available that can convert RTF files and LaTeX files to HTML. They are available for free download from the following Web sites:</p>

<ul>
<li>RTFtoHTML: <a href="http://www.sunpack.com/rtf/">http://www.sunpack.com/rtf/</a></li>
<li>LaTeX2HTML: <a href="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html">http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most Microsoft Word versions and many other word processors can
produce RTF output, so the RTFtoHTML utility can be used to produce
HTML from these.</p>

<p>To make the conversion task easier, ensure that tables and figures are inserted in the appropriate places, and make sure that tables in your manuscript are entered in your word processor as table objects (using e.g. the Table -&gt; Insert Table menu item in Microsoft Word.) Don't just enter the table as text aligned with tabs!</p>

<p>If you have HTML in which non-standard symbols (such as mathematical symbols) do not appear correctly, please include them as plain text alternatives or image (.gif) files to appear in the HTML version of your manuscript.</p>

<br>

<a name="update"></a>
<pre>
> I have recently archived a few manuscripts. How do I go about
> updating (if revision has taken place, or adding the reference after
> publication)?
</pre>

<p>We strongly encourage you to keep the old versions of your manuscripts in the archive, and deposit the new versions as well. The old version will be linked to the new version, so that anyone finding your old version from a search or an old link will be able to see that a newer version has been deposited.</p>

<p>The easiest way to deposit an updated version is to select the <A HREF="__perlroot__/author/review">review your documents in the archive</A> option from your <a href="__perlroot__/author/home">author area</A>. Find the document you want to deposit an updated version of, and select the `Clone' option. You should see a clone of the old version of the paper appear in your workspace. Select the clone, and click on "Edit". You can now upload your updated version, and the relevant "commentary" field (in the `succession/commentary' page) will have already been filled in. When your updated version is placed in the archive, the abstract pages of both old and new versions will show links to the other version.</P>

<br>

<a name="quality"></a>
<pre>
> Are there any limitations on what we can deposit in CogPrints? What is
> there to stop students clogging the archive up with all their essays? Is
> there any refereeing or quality assurance criterion before we post material
> to the archive?
</pre>

<p>Incoming submissions do not go straight into the archive; initially they
are placed in a "buffer". The papers in this buffer are then reviewed by
Stevan Harnad, and only those with content suitable for the archive are
installed. This prevents the archive becoming clogged up with unsuitable
material.</p>

<br>

<a name="copyright"</a>
<pre>
> What about the copyright issues associated with CogPrints? e.g. If I
> want to publish a paper in a "normal" journal: do I have to ask the
> journal's editor for permission to deposit the paper (non-refereed and
> refereed) to CogPrints?
</pre>

<p>The copyright issue is dealt with in the separate <a href="copyright.html">CogPrints copyright FAQ</a>.</p>

<br>

<a name="languages"></a>
<pre>
> Do you accept submissions in languages other than English?
</pre>

<p>We do accept papers written in any language. However, English is preferable, especially for the abstract (as entered in the WWW interface.)</p>

<br>

<a name="resubmit"></a>

<p>The problem is probably down to your Web browser. Most modern web browsers
"cache" (keep temporary copies of) files you view on the web. If you go
back to a page you've looked at already, the browser will use the cached
copy rather than go and retrieve the document from the web site again.</p>

<p>So, when you wanted to view your second deposited document, your browser
probably thought it had seen the document before and presented you with
its cached, out-of-date version. The solution is, when you view your
redeposited document, to click on your browser's "reload" button which
should make the browser go to the web site and retrieve the updated
version. On some browsers you may need to hold down the shift key while
you do this.</p>

<p>If this still doesn't work, you may have to go into your browser's
options/preferences screen and select the option "Clear caches" or
equivalent, and then view the document again.</p>

<a name="figures"></a>

</pre>

<p>One possible reason is that the case of the filenames in the document may be different from the actual file. Some servers and operating systems (for example, Microsoft Windows) are case-insensitive; that is, they ignore the case, so "figure1.gif" and "FIGURE1.GIF" refer to the same file. Others, such as Unix (the platform we use here at CogPrints) require that the case is <em>exactly</em> the same. You must make sure that the filename of your figure and the the reference in the document match exactly. This is a very common error.</p>
