=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions for handling unicode byte order marks, which are
to be found at the beginning of some files and streams.

For details about what a byte order mark is, see
L<http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM>

The intention of File::BOM is for files with BOMs to be readable as seamlessly
as possible, regardless of the encoding used. To that end, several different
interfaces are available, as shown in the synopsis above.

=head1 VARIABLES

=head2 %bom2enc

Maps Byte Order marks to their encodings.

The keys of this hash are strings which represent the BOMs, the values are their
encodings, in a format which is understood by L<Encode>

The encodings represented in this hash are: UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE,
UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE

=head2 %enc2bom

A reverse-lookup hash for bom2enc, with a few aliases used in L<Encode>, namely utf8, iso-10646-1 and UCS-2.

Note that UTF-16, UTF-32 and UCS-4 are not included in this hash. Mainly
because Encode::encode automatically puts BOMs on output. See L<Encode::Unicode>

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 open_bom

    $encoding = open_bom(HANDLE, $filename, $default_mode)

    ($encoding, $spill) = open_bom(HANDLE, $filename, $default_mode)

opens HANDLE for reading on $filename, setting the mode to the appropriate
encoding for the BOM stored in the file.

On failure, a fatal error is raised, see the DIAGNOSTICS section for details on
how to catch these. This is in order to allow the return value(s) to be used for
other purposes.

If the file doesn't contain a BOM, $default_mode is used instead. Hence:

    open_bom(FH, 'my_file.txt', ':utf8')

Opens my_file.txt for reading in an appropriate encoding found from the BOM in
that file, or as a UTF-8 file if none is found.

In the absence of a $default_mode argument, the following 2 calls should be equivalent:

    open_bom(FH, 'no_bom.txt');

    open(FH, '<', 'no_bom.txt');

If an undefined value is passed as the handle, a symbol will be generated for it
like open() does:

    # create filehandle on the fly
    $enc = open_bom(my $fh, $filename, ':utf8');
    $line = <$fh>;

The filehandle will be cued up to read after the BOM. Unseekable files (e.g.
fifos) will cause croaking, unless called in list context to catch spillage
from the handle. Any spillage will be automatically decoded from the encoding,
if found.

    e.g.

    # croak if my_socket is unseekable
    open_bom(FH, 'my_socket');

    # keep spillage if my_socket is unseekable
    ($encoding, $spillage) = open_bom(FH, 'my_socket');

    # discard any spillage from open_bom
    ($encoding) = open_bom(FH, 'my_socket');

=cut

sub open_bom (*$;$) {
    my($fh, $filename, $mode) = @_;
    if (defined $fh) {
	$fh = qualify_to_ref($fh, caller);
    }
    else {
	$fh = $_[0] = gensym();
    }

    my $enc;
    my $spill = '';

    open($fh, '<', $filename)
	or croak "Couldn't read '$filename': $!";

    if (wantarray) {
	($enc, $spill) = get_encoding_from_filehandle($fh);
    }
    else {
	$enc = get_encoding_from_filehandle($fh);
    }

    if ($enc) {
	$mode = ":encoding($enc)";

	$spill = decode($enc, $spill, FB_CROAK) if $spill;
    }

    if ($mode) {
	binmode($fh, $mode)
	    or croak "Couldn't set binmode of handle opened on '$filename' "
		   . "to '$mode': $!";
    }

    return wantarray ? ($enc, $spill) : $enc;
}

=head2 defuse

    $enc = defuse(FH);

    ($enc, $spill) = defuse(FH);

FH should be a filehandle opened for reading, it will have the relevant encoding
layer pushed onto it be binmode if a BOM is found. Spillage should be Unicode,
not bytes.

Any uncaptured spillage will be silently lost. If the handle is unseekable, use
list context to avoid data loss.

If no BOM is found, the mode will be unaffected.

=cut

sub defuse (*) {
    my $fh = qualify_to_ref(shift, caller);

    my($enc, $spill) = get_encoding_from_filehandle($fh);

    if ($enc) {

	$spill = decode($enc, $spill, FB_CROAK) if $spill;
    }

    return wantarray ? ($enc, $spill) : $enc;
}

=head2 decode_from_bom

    $unicode_string = decode_from_bom($string, $default, $check)

    ($unicode_string, $encoding) = decode_from_bom($string, $default, $check)

Reads a BOM from the beginning of $string, decodes $string (minus the BOM) and
returns it to you as a perl unicode string.

if $string doesn't have a BOM, $default is used instead.

$check, if supplied, is passed to Encode::decode as the third argument.

If there's no BOM and no default, the original string is returned and encoding
is ''.

See L<Encode>

=cut

sub decode_from_bom ($;$$) {
    my($string, $default, $check) = @_;

    croak "No string" unless defined $string;

    my($enc, $off) = get_encoding_from_bom($string);
    $enc ||= $default;

    my $out;
    if (defined $enc) {
	$out = decode($enc, substr($string, $off), $check);
    }
    else {
	$out = $string;
	$enc = '';
    }

    return wantarray ? ($out, $enc) : $out;
}

=head2 get_encoding_from_filehandle

    $encoding = get_encoding_from_filehandle(HANDLE)

    ($encoding, $spillage) = get_encoding_from_filehandle(HANDLE)

Returns the encoding found in the given filehandle.

The handle should be opened in a non-unicode way (e.g. mode '<:bytes') so that
the BOM can be read in its natural state.

After calling, the handle will be set to read at a point after the BOM (or at
the beginning of the file if no BOM was found)

If called in scalar context, unseekable handles cause a croak().

If called in list context, unseekable handles will be read byte-by-byte and any
spillage will be returned. See get_encoding_from_stream()

=cut

sub get_encoding_from_filehandle (*) {
    my $fh = qualify_to_ref(shift, caller);

    my $enc;
    my $spill = '';
    if (seek($fh, 0, SEEK_SET)) {
	$enc = _get_encoding_seekable($fh);
    }
    elsif (wantarray) {
	($enc, $spill) = _get_encoding_unseekable($fh);
    }
    else {
	croak "Unseekable handle: $!";
    }

    return wantarray ? ($enc, $spill) : $enc;
}

=head2 get_encoding_from_stream

    ($encoding, $spillage) = get_encoding_from_stream(*FH);

Read a BOM from an unrewindable source. This means reading the stream one byte
at a time until either a BOM is found or every possible BOM is ruled out. Any
non-BOM bytes read from the handle will be returned in $spillage.

If a BOM is found and the spillage contains a partial character (judging by the
expected character width for the encoding) more bytes will be read from the
handle to ensure that a complete character is returned.

Spillage is always in bytes, not characters.

This function is less efficient than get_encoding_from_filehandle, but should
work just as well on a seekable handle as on an unseekable one.

=head2 get_encoding_from_bom

    ($encoding, $offset) = get_encoding_from_bom($string)

Returns the encoding and length in bytes of the BOM in $string.

If there is no BOM, an empty string is returned and $offset is zero.

To get the data from the string, the following should work: 

    use Encode;

    my($encoding, $offset) = get_encoding_from_bom($string);

    if ($encoding) {
	$string = decode($encoding, substr($string, $offset))
    }

    if (my($found) = $bom =~ $bom_re) {
	$encoding = $bom2enc{$found};
	$offset = length($found);
    }

    return ($encoding, $offset);
}

# Internal:
# Work out character length for given encoding and spillage byte
sub _get_char_length ($$) {
    my($enc, $byte) = @_;

    if ($enc eq 'UTF-8') {
	if (($byte & 0x80) == 0) {
	    return 1;
	}
	else {
	    my $length = 0;

	    1 while (($byte << $length++) & 0xc0) == 0xc0;

	    return $length;
	}
    }
    elsif ($enc =~ /^UTF-(16|32)/) {
	return $1 / 8;
    }
    else {
	return;
    }
}

=head1 PerlIO::via interface

File::BOM can be used as a PerlIO::via interface.

    open(HANDLE, '<:via(File::BOM)', 'my_file.txt');

    open(HANDLE, '>:encoding(UTF-16LE):via(File::BOM)', 'out_file.txt)
    print "foo\n"; # BOM is written to file here

This method is less prone to errors on non-seekable files as spillage is
incorporated into an internal buffer, but it doesn't give you any information
about the encoding being used, or indeed whether or not a BOM
was present.

There are a few known problems with this interface, especially surrounding
seek() and tell(), please see the BUGS section for more details about this.

=head2 Reading

The via(File::BOM) layer must be added before the handle is read from, otherwise
any BOM will be missed. If there is no BOM, no decoding will be done.

Because of a limitation in PerlIO::via, read() always works on bytes, not characters. BOM decoding will still be done but output will be bytes of UTF-8.

    open(BOM, '<:via(File::BOM)', $file)
    $bytes_read = read(BOM, $buffer, $length);
    $unicode = decode('UTF-8', $buffer, Encode::FB_QUIET);

    # Now $unicode is valid unicode and $buffer contains any left-over bytes

=head2 Writing

Add the via(File::BOM) layer on top of a unicode encoding layer to print a BOM
at the start of the output file. This needs to be done before any data is
written. The BOM is written as part of the first print command on the handle, so
if you don't print anything to the handle, you won't get a BOM.

There is a "Wide character in print" warning generated when the via(File::BOM)
layer doesn't receive utf8 on writing. This glitch was resolved in perl version
5.8.7, but if your perl version is older than that, you'll need to make sure
that the via(File::BOM) layer receives utf8 like this:

    # This works OK
    open(FH, '>:encoding(UTF-16LE):via(File::BOM):utf8', $filename)

    # This generates warnings with older perls
    open(FH, '>:encoding(UTF-16LE):via(File::BOM)', $filename)

=head2 Seeking

Seeking with SEEK_SET results in an offset equal to the length of any detected
BOM being applied to the position parameter. Thus:

    # Seek to end of BOM (not start of file!)
    seek(FILE_BOM_HANDLE, 0, SEEK_SET)

=head2 Telling

In order to work correctly with seek(), tell() also returns a position adjusted
by the length of the BOM.

=head1 BUGS

Older versions of PerlIO::via have a few problems with writing, see above.

The current version of PerlIO::via has limitations with regard to seek and tell,
currently only line-wise seek and tell are supported by this module. If read()
is used to read partial lines, tell() will still give the position of the end of
the last line read.

Under windows, tell() seems to return erroneously when reading files with unix
line endings.

Under windows, warnings may be generated when using the PerlIO::via interface to
read UTF-16LE and UTF-32LE encoded files. This seems to be a bug in the relevant
encoding(...) layers.
