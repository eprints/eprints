<p>You need to register in order to be able to deposit items in the 
repository. </p>

<p>As a registered user you will be able to manage your items, up to the point
of submitting them for Editorial Review. If the review is successful your 
item will be deposited in the repository, if it is unsuccessful it will be 
returned to you with editorial comments.</p>

<p>In addition to managing your items a registered user can set up
alert options, so that email notifications are sent when new items 
are placed in the repository.</p>

<p>Please complete the details on this page to register with <epc:phrase ref="archive_name" />.</p>

<p>The registration process uses email to send you details of how to activate
your account. You must then check your email and activate your password. Once
activated you can start to use the registered features of the repository.</p>

<p>If you have already registered but have forgotten your username or password,
<a href="reset_password">click here</a> to set a new password.</p>
