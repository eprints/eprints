This is the rough and ready list of stuff that needs doing on
eprints 2. It's really for my benefit, I include it here in
case it might be helpful.

SQL Tables

-	Add time:lastwrite & time:lastindex to each dataset  - either in 
	index or main table.

Subscriptions/subject-editors

*	Subject-editors (editors can only edit within certain subjects/search)

*	Alerts for editors about things they can edit (flag in User fields?)

Metadata Fields

*	Hide ID for non-staff option for has-id fields

+	New field type "time" for datetime SQL fields.

+	Field property: freetext (or not-freetext) to stop indexing) - will 
	disable non-ex searching. (?)

+	Field Property: 'id required' - If main bit is set then ID *must* 
	be set. Otherwise lax.

+ 	Make Hide Lineage/Honourific a field property.

+	Add XHTML field renderer with list of legal tags.


XML, Bibtex and Misc formats in & out

-	Some kind of BibTeX support (fill in metadata form from bibtex) 
	- library function plus cgi + bin tools? 

+	Some kind of RIS format import (similar to bibtex). 

- 	Bibtex import/export

+	XML Importer

OAI

-	Extra sets in OAI: By ID field, or by configurable serialised search. 
	Even "subject" should be configured. so "subject:blgy:biophys" 
	or "username_id:cjg" or "stuffjackwants" which is a search of 
	it's own. Searches can of course be modified with from and to 
	dates from OAI.

-	Add a filter - eg. to limit ever showing records to post 2000.

Database

-	Turn docid into an int (no minor feat)

+ 	check Database.pm for any sql without escaping. and 
	SearchExpression.pm and SearchField.pm 


Browse Views

* 	Time stamp views [optionally] - done but not an option

+	Second level views - eg. /group/year/ - /view/iam/2001.html

* 	Browse on "name" fields


Searches

*	Make entire search page a phrase so that it can be configured. eg.
	&buttons; &results; etc.

*	Deprecate temporary tables and just make oneshot_cache the 
	 default?

+	Add congiguration via cookie for n results, citation style &
         default search.

-	Don't index words in inbox/buffer? [maybe/maybe not]

+	Reindex via script rather than on the fly?

*	Add search-by-id

- 	max time for caches eg. 30 for latest?

-	Improve name search syntax (?)

+	Munge umlauts etc when searching names.

-	Phrase searching

-	Improved steming.

-	Merge int/name/text searches 

-	Add a get_problems method to searchexp which returns a list
	of problems. This should run by default when verifying "search"
	type fields?

-	Create buffer uses VARCHAR for a key, not.. er... INT where possible.
	 eg. for subject and document

Installer / Package Builder

-	Make a simple version of file upload for archives which only want one
         (PDF) document with no security etc.

Command Line Tools

.	generate_views needs to say what order stuff is in. [kinda hard, it
	uses a custom order]

*	Clean up export XML command. [XML headers etc.]

-	For generate_views, subscriptions, abstracts etc. Maybe have an
         archiveid of ALL which runs the script once for each archive?

.	Make tools run as "eprints" if they are running as "root". 
	-Forces "Taint" checking which certain eprints bits just can't darn
 	handle.

*	MD5 digest all documents.

Submission Page

*	Deposit now/Deposit Later page as last part of normal 
	sumbission.

*	Change it so it goes back to the front page after submission
	or even a page explaining how to deposit.

*	Change the text of the user home page to explain the above.


Other Stuff

-	Various "form letters" from the editor.

*	Need a "Last Changed" datestamp. Always set in commit. (On ALL
        dataobj types?)

*	Make a permission for users to be able to edit their OWN record.

*       Make a way of .css working in both https and http - possibly
        a new entity which does something different on the https server.

-	CSS searchfield input.

+	Option for "subjects" to not appear with heirarchy when presented
	in input forms.

*	Make "Submit Later" option on submit form final page.

*	Make EPrint->new_from_data work the same as document, eprint etc.

-	Turn Multiple input fields into <ol>'s. maybe?

.	Commentary summary page (Psycoloquy style)

+	Rename "create_foo" on DataObjs onto just "create".

+	Stop refering directly to System::Settings - allow archive specific
	tweaks.

-	Remove all #cjg comments which denote issues.

+	cmp methods : is they still needed?

+	Make all needed get()'s map it instead so ready for that 
	1,000,000 papers.

+ 	List of editors?

-	langid's -> validate they is correct (in multilang)

+	No new eprints when disk fullish

+	Bad Things(tm) will happen if a session has a langid which is not a 
	supported langid - can this happen?

* 	Add option to supress empty subjects in browse views.

+ 	robots.txt file

- 	XML GDOME readyness

+ 	Lose all die statements

+ 	Check Referer on LatexCache.?

*	testing to see if "dom" is set in generate_views seems kinda pointless.

? 	setlang - show all langs, flag supported.

- 	Debugging helpers - make session and searchexp notice if they are 
	DESTROY'd without being terminate/disposed.

-	PDF Mollycoddler ( Serve PDF in a special way which avoids certain 
	bugs in the plugin )

-	CSS Mollycoddler ( Serve an empty CSS if a 404 is encountered when
	looking for a .css file - to help out NS4.)

-	Make some eprint types require different/no document types, eg. 
	books.
